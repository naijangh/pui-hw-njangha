/*what needs to happen here:
- micron.js for little animations
- random generator function for drinks on today's orders
- function to populate html with random drinks
- each image needs a js counterpart to trigger a response when clicked?
- way to store which element was clicked and calculate if it was the correct one (like hangman guessing game js or tic tac toe?)
- basic function that takes user input and sees if it is correct and in the right order (1 then 2 then 3) and using if..then statements
